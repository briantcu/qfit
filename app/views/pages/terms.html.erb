    Notice To California Residents – Your California Privacy Rights:
    Effective January 1, 2005, California Civil Code Section 1798.83 (known as the “Shine the Light” law) requires that if a business has an established business relationship with a California resident and has within the immediately preceding calendar year disclosed such resident’s personal information to a third party, knowing or having reason to know that such third party used the information for its direct marketing purposes, then the business must disclose such information-sharing to the resident upon request, including what personal information was shared, and with whom it was shared. A business is deemed in compliance with this law if: (1) it has a published privacy policy of not sharing a customer’s personal information with third parties for direct marketing purposes without the customer’s consent (either opt-in or opt-out); and (2) it provides the customer upon request with a notice of his/her choice to prevent such sharing and a cost-free means to exercise that choice. As a general matter, consent by “opt-in” means that a business will not share a customer’s personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use, unless the customer affirmatively consents to such sharing (e.g., by checking a box or clicking on a button to manifest consent). On the other hand, consent by “opt-out” means that a business may share a customer’s personal information with third parties for their direct marketing use, unless the customer expressly disallows or objects to such sharing (e.g., by checking a box or clicking on a button to manifest disallowance or objection).
    As stated above, Quadfit does not disclose your personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes, unless with your affirmative consent (i.e., “opt-in”).
